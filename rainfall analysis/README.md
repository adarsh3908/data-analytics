# Rainfall Analysis - India Climate Patterns (1901-2015)

## Project Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of rainfall patterns in India over 115 years (1901-2015) to understand climate trends, seasonal variations, and anomalous weather events. The analysis combines traditional statistical methods with modern machine learning techniques for anomaly detection and time series forecasting.

## Methodology

### Statistical Analysis Techniques
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, standard deviation, trend analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation coefficients between seasons
- **Rolling Averages**: 10-year moving averages for trend smoothing
- **Threshold Analysis**: 1.5 standard deviation bounds for extreme event detection

### Machine Learning Approaches
- **Isolation Forest**: Unsupervised anomaly detection for identifying unusual rainfall years
- **Facebook Prophet**: Advanced time series forecasting with trend and seasonality components
- **Contamination Analysis**: 5% contamination rate for anomaly detection sensitivity

- **Time Series Plots**: Long-term trend visualization
- **Box Plots**: Seasonal distribution comparison
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Inter-seasonal relationship analysis
- **Anomaly Scatter Plots**: Highlighting unusual weather events

## Key Findings

### Long-term Climate Trends
- **Overall Pattern**: Slight declining trend in annual rainfall over 115 years
- **Variability**: High inter-annual variability with periodic cycles
- **Climate Change Impact**: Detectable changes in rainfall patterns post-1980s

### Seasonal Insights
- **Monsoon Dominance**: Jun-Sep season contributes ~70% of annual rainfall
- **Monthly Peak**: July typically shows highest average rainfall
- **Seasonal Correlation**: Strong positive correlation between monsoon and annual rainfall

### Extreme Weather Events
- **Drought Years**: Identified using statistical thresholds (mean - 1.5*std)
- **Flood Years**: Extreme rainfall years detected (mean + 1.5*std)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning identifies ~5% of years as anomalous

### Future Projections
- **20-Year Forecast**: Prophet model provides rainfall projections to 2035
- **Trend Continuation**: Model suggests continuation of current variability patterns
- **Uncertainty Bounds**: Confidence intervals indicate prediction reliability
