# Batting Intent Analysis - IPL Cricket Data

This project provides comprehensive analysis of batting intent patterns in IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket matches using ball-by-ball delivery data. The analysis reveals how different batsmen approach various phases of the game and their overall batting strategies.

## Files
- `Batting Intent Analysis.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis and visualizations
- `ipl_match_1473461_deliveries.csv` - Dataset containing ball-by-ball IPL match data

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

### **Objective**
Analyze batting intent and strategies in cricket by examining strike rates, boundary percentages, and performance patterns across different match phases and player profiles.

### **Key Questions Answered**
- How do batsmen adapt their playing style across different match phases?
- Which players are most aggressive vs defensive in their approach?
- How do teams perform collectively in different phases?
- What is the relationship between scoring rate and wicket-taking patterns?

## ðŸ”¹ Detailed Analysis

### **1. Data Structure**
- **Source**: IPL ball-by-ball delivery data
- **Key Fields**:
  - `batter`: Name of the batsman
  - `runs_batter`: Runs scored by batsman on each ball
  - `over`: Over number in the match
  - `team`: Batting team
  - `player_out`: Player dismissed (if any)

### **2. Phase Classification**
Cricket matches are divided into strategic phases:
- **Powerplay (Overs 1-6)**: Fielding restrictions, aggressive batting opportunities
- **Middle Overs (Overs 7-15)**: Consolidation phase, steady accumulation
- **Death Overs (Overs 16-20)**: Final push, maximum aggression required

### **3. Key Metrics Analyzed**

#### **Strike Rate**
- Runs scored per 100 balls faced
- Primary measure of batting aggression
- Formula: `(Total Runs / Balls Faced) Ã— 100`

#### **Boundary Percentage**
- Percentage of balls that result in boundaries (4s and 6s)
- Indicates aggressive shot selection
- Higher percentage = more attacking approach

#### **Dot Ball Percentage**
- Percentage of balls faced without scoring
- Indicates defensive play or struggle against bowling
- Lower percentage = better run-scoring ability

#### **Batting Average**
- Runs scored per dismissal
- Measure of consistency and reliability
- Formula: `Total Runs / Number of Dismissals`

### **4. Analysis Components**

#### **Individual Player Analysis**
- Strike rate comparison across match phases
- Personal batting style identification
- Consistency patterns over different overs

#### **Team Performance Analysis**
- Collective batting strategies by teams
- Phase-wise team aggression levels
- Comparative team analysis

#### **Ball Outcome Analysis**
- Distribution of dot balls, singles, and boundaries
- Relationship between aggression and success
- Risk-reward assessment

#### **Progressive Analysis**
- Over-by-over run accumulation patterns
- Acceleration/deceleration trends
- Top performer consistency tracking

#### **Match Dynamics**
- Correlation between runs scored and wickets fallen
- Pressure points in matches
- Optimal scoring periods

#### **Multi-Dimensional Profiling**
- Radar chart visualization of player profiles
- Comprehensive metric comparison
- Batting style fingerprinting

## ðŸ”¹ Key Findings

### **Batting Patterns**
- **Powerplay Strategy**: Most aggressive phase with highest strike rates
- **Middle Overs Approach**: Consolidation with selective aggression
- **Death Overs Intensity**: Maximum risk-taking with varied success rates

### **Player Insights**
- **Aggressive Players**: High boundary percentage, moderate dot ball rate
- **Defensive Players**: Lower strike rates but better averages
- **Consistent Performers**: Balanced metrics across all phases

### **Team Strategies**
- **Top-order Focus**: Teams rely heavily on early wicket partnerships
- **Phase Adaptation**: Successful teams adapt strategy to match situation
- **Risk Management**: Balance between aggression and wicket preservation

## ðŸ”¹ Visualizations

1. **Grouped Bar Charts**: Strike rate comparison across phases
2. **Team Comparison Charts**: Phase-wise team performance
3. **Outcome Distribution**: Boundary vs dot ball percentages
4. **Line Graphs**: Over-wise progression analysis
5. **Dual-Axis Plots**: Runs vs wickets relationship
6. **Radar Charts**: Multi-dimensional player profiling

## ðŸ”¹ Technical Requirements

### **Python Libraries**
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib**: Basic plotting and visualization
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **numpy**: Numerical operations and calculations

### **Additional Libraries**
- **math**: Mathematical operations for radar charts

## ðŸ”¹ Usage Instructions

### **Setup**
1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy`
3. Place `ipl_match_1473461_deliveries.csv` in the same directory as the notebook

### **Running the Analysis**
1. Open `Batting Intent Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook/Lab
2. Run cells sequentially for complete analysis
3. Each cell contains detailed comments explaining the analysis

### **Data Requirements**
- **Minimum Sample Size**: Players with at least 5-10 balls faced for statistical significance
- **Data Quality**: Clean ball-by-ball data with consistent formatting
- **File Format**: CSV with required columns (batter, runs_batter, over, team, player_out)
